/// Client interface for accessing resources wrapped in a [`DriverMutex`]

/// This trait must be implemented by any kernel object wishing to access a resource managed by a
/// `DriverMutex`. The trait defines a single callback method `ready()` which will be invoked by the
/// `DriverMutex` when the resource becomes available.
///
/// Note that this contract does not directly provide a [`DriverMutexRef`], but rather an instance
/// of [`DriverMutexAny`]. It is the responsibility of the client to downcast the `DriverMutexAny`
/// into the appropriate concrete type `T` before it can be used.
///
/// The reason for this extra indirection/reflection is to facilitate complex clients needing to
/// interact with multiple `DriverMutex` instances. If we had made `DriverMutexClient` generic over
/// `T`, then it would be practically impossible for such clients to `impl` the trait multiple times
/// for each different `T` type, as doing so would cause Rust to complain about
/// ambiguous/conflicting trait implementations.

/// Handles are used internally by [`DriverMutex`] to determine _which_ client is requesting access
/// to the resource. A new, unique handle value is returned from each call to
/// [`DriverMutex::add_client()`], and the client is expected to retain its handle so that it can be
/// used later to request the resource.

/// Specialized mutex used to guard HIL driver implementations
///
/// `DriverMutex` is a container type which wraps and provides mutual exclusion semantics for a HIL
/// implementation within the Tock kernel. Even though Tock is fundamentally single-threaded, it is
/// nevertheless highly concurrent and therefore susceptible to race conditions within its event
/// loop when multiple kernel components are sharing the same underlying HIL driver.
///
/// ## Queuing
///
/// `DriverMutex` contains an integrated request queue. Multiple clients can
/// [request][DriverMutex::request] access to the underlying resource, and they will be given access
/// on a first-come first-served basis (as opposed to a traditional mutex, which would just return
/// some "busy" error code).
///
/// The length of the internal queue is fixed, meaning it can only support a limited number of
/// clients. Queue length is specified at construction time and may vary from instance to instance
/// as needed.
///
/// ## RAII
///
/// Access to the underlying resource is mediated via [`DriverMutexAny`] and [`DriverMutexRef`].
/// These are RAII guards which "release" the mutex upon being dropped. This provides some level of
/// assurance at compile time that the underlying resource can only be accessed _while_ the mutex is
/// held.
///
/// When the last guard for the active client is dropped, the mutex is effectively released. If
/// another client is queued, a new RAII guard is passed to its
/// [`ready()`][DriverMutexClient::ready] callback. This process is carried out within a
/// [deferred call][DeferredCall] to avoid doing too much work directly within the RAII `drop()`
/// method, which could otherwise lead to reentrancy hazards, poor performance, or overly deep call
/// stacks.
///
/// ## Reference Counting
///
/// To support more complex scenarios, the same client may request access to the mutex multiple
/// times. Instead of being added to the internal queue, the client's `ready()` callback is
/// scheduled again, even while the client still holds one or more `DriverMutexAny` or
/// `DriverMutexRef` instances.
///
/// Internally, the mutex maintains a count of each reference provided through the `ready()`
/// callback. This count is decremented whenever a reference is dropped. The mutex considers the
/// resource to be free only when this count reaches zero, at which point a new `ready()` callback
/// is scheduled for the next client from the queue.
///
/// Due to the asynchronous nature of this mutex, it is possible for a client to call `request()`,
/// then drop all its outstanding RAII guards _before_ the `ready()` callback is invoked, causing
/// the reference count to reach zero. The `DriverMutex` explicitly handles this case, ensuring the
/// resource remains locked until the pending `ready()` callback can be delivered.
///
/// Note that clients are still not permitted to have multiple outstanding requests. Each time a
/// client calls `request()`, it must wait until its `ready()` callback is invoked before calling
/// `request()` again.
///
/// ### Motivation for Reference Counting
///
/// Why go to the lengths of supporting this admittedly complex scheme?
///
/// It turns out there are some real world scenarios in which a kernel component needs to consume
/// services from multiple different HIL implementations, `A: Foo` and `B: Bar`. This component
/// would typically contain two references `&DriverMutex<A>` and `&DriverMutex<B>` which it can use
/// to access the corresponding drivers.
///
/// But depending on the topology of the underlying chip or board, the `Foo` and `Bar` traits may
/// either be implemented by different drivers or possibly by the same driver. For instance, some
/// chips may implement ECC and RSA acceleration using a generic "crypto" IP block, while other
/// chips may provide separate blocks (and thus separate drivers) for these functions.
///
/// By using the reference counting approach, drivers which consume `Foo` and `Bar` can be written
/// to support both topologies transparently. The respective mutexes for `A` and `B` may point to
/// different drivers. Or in the case that `A` and `B` are actually the same type, both of the
/// consumer's `&DriverMutex` references may literally refer back to the same individual mutex
/// instance. Either way, the consumer may use the same set of APIs to access the underlying
/// resource.
